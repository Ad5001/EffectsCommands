# EffectsCommands
Adding yourself effects with VERY shorts commands
##- Description:
###What is this plugin about?
This plugin add short commands for adding yourself effects (e.g. /speed <amplifier>, see more in "Commands" section) and combinations of effects (e.g. /allspeed <amplifier>).
###Which effects are on this plugins?
All positive one that are currently available on Imagicalmine.
###What can we modify on effect using those commands?
You can actualy modify the amplifier on some effects (Effects as Invisibility or Night Vision has no differences between amplifiers, that's why you cannot modify it!).
###Are particules on?
No, of curse not! Because for effects as invisibility won't be able to be fully as natural as possible. A bug (I think it's a bug) make the effect icon invisible too!
###How long does we keep effects?
Forever until you do "/eclear [EffectYouWantToClear]" (e.g. /eclear speed) , "/eclear" to clear all your effects or "/(effectcommand) 0" (e.g. /speed 0).
